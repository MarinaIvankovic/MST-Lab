# MST-Lab
It contains the program used for the noise modelling as well as the corresponding measured data. The repository includes three main scripts: 
- main_modell: for noise modelling with a capacitor at the input
- main_only_cabel: for noise modelling with the cable capacitance considered at the input
- Open_Loop_modell: based on an open-loop noise modelling approach.

In "Measured Data.zip" you can find all measured results.
